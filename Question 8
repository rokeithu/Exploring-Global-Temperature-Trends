#Question 8
#GNUPplot graph of  land average temperature, land max temperature and land min temperature for the years between 1850 and 2015:

#Setting the Names of the Title, X-Axis, and Y-Axis
set title "Yearly Average Temperatures (1850-2015)"
set xlabel "Year"
set ylabel "Temperature (Â°C)"

#Setting the ranges for the X-Axis and Y-Axis
set xrange [1850:2015]
set yrange [0:20]

#Selecting the settings of the line style
set style line 1 lc rgb 'red' lw 2
set style line 2 lc rgb 'purple' lw 1
set style line 3 lc rgb 'blue' lw 1

#Plotting the data by reading the values on the second, third, and fourth column of the data file and applying the line style with labeling the data within a legend
